# Software Engineering Projects

This repository showcases a series of projects that demonstrate a variety of technologies and architectures. The projects span different programming languages and frameworks, focusing on multi-threading, distributed systems, cloud deployment, and more.  The first one, Full-Stack Web Application is complete.  The Rests are TODO which pick elements of technologies I've been exposed to in my career.

## Projects Overview

### 1. [Full-Stack Web Application](./fullstack-web-app)
- **Technologies**: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- **Description**: This project is a full-featured web application that showcases both front-end and back-end development skills using React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Docker. The application also integrates a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for streamlined testing and deployment.

### 2. [Distributed Microservices with Go and gRPC](./distributed-microservices-with-go-and-gRPC)
- **Technologies**: Go, gRPC, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Description**: Create a distributed application with microservices that communicate using gRPC. The services simulate real-world use cases like order processing, inventory management, and user authentication.

### 3. [Concurrency-Heavy System with C++](./concurrency-heavy-system-with-cplusplus)
- **Technologies**: C++, POSIX Threads, Boost, Docker
- **Description**: Build a multi-threaded real-time data processing system in C++. This system ingests data from multiple sources and processes it concurrently to simulate an industrial IoT application or financial transaction system.
- **Focus**: Thread safety, synchronization, message passing, CPU optimization.

### 4. [Python API with AsyncIO and FastAPI](./python-api-with-asyncIO-and-fastAPI)
- **Technologies**: Python, FastAPI, AsyncIO, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker
- **Description**: Develop an asynchronous REST API for a fast, real-time application like a chat system or stock price tracker. Integrate it with a Postgres database for persistence and Redis for caching.
- **Focus**: API design, database transactions, handling high concurrent requests.

### 5. [Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka Streams](./event-driven-architecture-with-kafka-streams)
- **Technologies**: JavaScript, Node.js, Kafka Streams, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Description**: Set up an event-driven architecture where events from multiple producers are processed and consumed using Kafka Streams. The application simulates a real-time analytics dashboard.
- **Focus**: Real-time streaming, fault tolerance, data pipeline.

### 6. [CRUD-based Application with TypeScript and GraphQL](./crud-based-app-with-typescript-and-graphQL)
- **Technologies**: TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, React, PostgreSQL
- **Description**: Build a full-featured web app (such as a project management tool) using TypeScript and GraphQL for both front-end and back-end. Incorporate user authentication, role management, and API security.
- **Focus**: Object-oriented design, security, API testing, and database optimization.

### 7. [CI/CD Pipeline for Python Testing Framework](./ci-cd-pipeline-for-python-testing-framework)
- **Technologies**: Python, PyTest, Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- **Description**: Build a continuous integration and deployment pipeline for a Python-based software testing framework. The framework is built for testing various APIs or full-stack applications.
- **Focus**: Test automation, CI/CD, pipeline optimization.

### 8. [Networking Application in Go](./networking-application-in-go)
- **Technologies**: Go, gRPC, Docker, Prometheus
- **Description**: Create a client-server application that handles complex network protocols (e.g., WebSocket or gRPC). The project simulates a multiplayer game server with matchmaking capabilities.
- **Focus**: Networking, efficient data transmission, performance monitoring.

### 9. [IoT Device Integration with AWS IoT Core](./IoT-device-int-with-AWS-IoT-core)
- **Technologies**: AWS IoT Core, MQTT, AWS IAM, AWS S3, AWS DynamoDB, AWS CloudWatch, Terraform, AWS Certificate Manager
- **Description**: An IoT solution that integrates AWS IoT Core and MQTT for real-time device communication and data streaming.
- **Focus**: Real-time networking, efficient data transmission via MQTT, and performance monitoring using AWS CloudWatch, with Terraform for automated infrastructure management.
## Focus Areas for Projects

- **Multi-threading**: Development of concurrency-heavy applications that handle parallel tasks.
- **Distributed Architecture**: Building systems that span across different nodes using microservices and message-passing techniques.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploying applications to cloud environments like AWS or GCP.
- **Load Balancing**: Ensuring efficient distribution of network traffic across multiple servers.
- **Internet of Things**: Managing frameworks to support IoT devices with high availability and fault tolerance.

## Additional Notes

- The projects could range from testing software (all forms), object-oriented design, multi-threading, network, and database applications (CRUD).
- The programming languages used include Python, JavaScript, C, C++, Go, and TypeScript.
- The architectures explored include cloud-based applications, on-premises distributed applications, messaging, and stand-alone applications.
