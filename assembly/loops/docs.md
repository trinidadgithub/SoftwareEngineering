Assembly Code "loops" Project README

### Overview

Inspired from:  https://github.com/bddicken/languages

This project demonstrates how to implement a simple program in x86-64 assembly language using the NASM assembler. The program performs the following tasks:

1. Parses an integer input from the command line.

2. Generates a random number and performs a series of computations on a large array.

3. Prints the result of one of the computed elements.

4. Includes functionality to handle invalid input gracefully.

The code is a mix of assembly programming concepts, including loops, function calls, and system calls.

### Prerequisites

Tools Required:

1. NASM: The Netwide Assembler for assembling .asm files.

2. GCC: For linking the object file to create the executable.

3. Linux Environment: The program is written for Linux x86-64.

### Installation:

To install NASM and GCC on a Debian-based system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nasm gcc -y
```

### Assembly Code Highlights

#### Main Sections:

1. Data Section:

- Declares the array, format strings, and error messages.

```bash
section .data
    a times 10000 dd 0             ; Array of 10k elements initialized to 0
    format db "%d", 10, 0          ; Format string for printf
    invalid_msg db "Invalid input. Please provide a positive integer.", 10, 0 ; Error message
```
2. BSS Section:

- Allocates uninitialized space for intermediate results.

```bash
section .bss
    result resd 1                  ; Space for the result
```

3. Text Section:

- Implements the main logic using _start as the entry point.

```bash
section .text
    global _start
    extern atoi, rand, printf

_start:
    ; Logic to parse input, perform computations, and print results.
```

### How to Compile and Run

Step 1: Write the Assembly Code

Save the assembly code in a file named code.asm.

Step 2: Assemble the Code

Use NASM to assemble the .asm file into an object file:
```bash
nasm -f elf64 code.asm -o code.o
```
Step 3: Link the Object File

Use GCC to link the object file into an executable:
```bash
gcc code.o -o code -no-pie -nostartfiles -lc
```
Step 4: Run the Program

Run the executable with a command-line argument:
```bash
./code 42
```
Example Output:

For a valid input:
```bash
$ ./code 42
12345
```
For an invalid input (e.g., no argument):
```bash
$ ./code
Invalid input. Please provide a positive integer.
```
### Future Enhancements

Standalone Implementation: Replace the use of atoi, rand, and printf with custom assembly implementations.

Input Validation: Add checks for non-numeric input.

Performance Optimizations: Unroll loops for better execution speed.
