Virtual Memory Heatmap:  Create a tool that reads /proc/meminfo and /proc/[pid]/smaps to generate a heatmap of memory usage acroos virtual memory regions.

Plan

1. Read Data Sources:
- Use /proc/meminfo for overall memory statistics.
- Use /proc/[pid]/smaps to gather details about memory regions of a process.

2. Parse Data:
- Parse /proc/meminfo to understand system-wide memory stats.
- Parse /proc/[pid]/smaps to break down memory usage into categories like heap, stack, shared libraries, and code.

3. Generate Heatmap:
- Represent the memory usage using ASCII art or by generating a file for tools like Matplotlib or GNUplot.
- Assign a color intensity (or character) based on usage levels.

4. Enhance Visualization:
- Use terminal graphics libraries like ncurses for a real-time interactive view.
- Optionally, output the data in a format compatible with external visualization tools.

5. User Interface:
- Allow the user to specify a process ID (pid) to monitor.
- Provide a summary of memory usage along with the heatmap.

First Steps

1. Write a program to read and parse /proc/meminfo and /proc/[pid]/smaps.
2. Represent memory regions and their sizes in a heatmap using ASCII art.
3. Implement user input for selecting a pid
