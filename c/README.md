### A collection of c programs, I have built a number of them over the years and this is their new home

[binary-to-decimal](./binary-to-decimal):  A study in bit shifting for converting binary to decimal  
[db](./db):  A small database built in c, based on the sqllite architecture.  
[sorting](./sorting/): A collection of classic sorting algorithms.  More will be added as time permits.  There is a directory, [animators](./sorting/animators), that contains python scripts to generate the gifs.
[url-download](./sorting/): This is a basic implementation of a command-line tool that downloads web content using libcurl and saves it to a file. The filename is derived from the URL provided, ensuring a unique name for each download.
